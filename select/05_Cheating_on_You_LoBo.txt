Over and over it's all I've had on my mind
Baby baby, I've been lying to you all this time
He is not what you think he is and I'm sharing the blame
Cause I've known all of this time he was playing the game

He's been cheating on you
He's been cheating on you
It's tearing me in two
That he's been cheating on you

Waiting and hoping that someone else would tell you
So afraid if I told you you might think it's not true
Cause you know how much I've loved you for so long
And I was going out of my head and I couldn't hold any longer

He's been cheating on you
He's been cheating on you
It's tearing me in two
That he's been cheating on you

He's been cheating on you
He's been cheating on you
It's tearing me in two
That he's been cheating on you

Cheating on you(cheating on you)
He's been cheating on you baby
(Cheating on you)
