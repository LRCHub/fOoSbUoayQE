Too much love, too many nights together
I said back then I wish these times could last forever and baby they have
'Cause right out of the blue your memory appears
And you might as well be standing here
When I'm with someone new I feel like I'm cheating on you.

You'd think by now I wouldn't know how to start over
Once in awhile someone will lay their head on my shoulder
And we get closer, I think I'm falling, I think I'm free
Then it all falls apart 'cause it's not you and me
That's what I'm going through
I feel like I'm cheating on you.

How long will it take for my heart to break
Away from you and never look back again
I can't give you up cause I'm not strong enough
To forget about remembering when
Right out of the blue your memory appears
And you might as well be standing here
When I'm with somebody new I feel like I'm cheating on you...
