If I sleep with my gun is that cheating on wifey
I have to these niggas don't like me
I don't mind a likkle pressure or a likkle drama
Pull up with your gang I do it how you want tah
See I don't really speak, I just mmm hmm hmm
You ain't really street but mmm hmm hmm
My gyal wanna get the hmm hmm hmm
Give her that lit like mmmm hmm

Gyal what gives, sorry not bank
One question, are you gunna off pant
Man's hot topic
Adam, Ishmael, Ibrahim sorry I'm just counting the profit
Big long coat when I enter, wait
I think I'm the black Arsène Wenger
Aim at your centre, tell me where your friends are
The ting went rrrah bet them man can't rrremember
Got a couple marlis that don't do raggar
Got no sabr, big fucking hammer
And they always ask me the same damn question
Should I stab with dagger or shoot make splatter
Something dangerous in the night bag
I came with the crazy looking white lad
He looks kinda Irish, straps for a fivish
And he's from joints Arthritis, Ay
Tell that gyal this is mint get your hand off
Real like Ramos, Gris like Cavos
Swap your flat from her jewels if I knock a couple grand off
Big Stones in my hand got me feeling like Thanos
Just a young nigga getting rich
Money like Mitch
Hussle like Nip
Used to have a big stick in the crib
Now I got a big crib in the sticks Ay

Got-got something under the puffer
Red devil but I came with a gunner
Diors in the Spring double Gs in the Summer
Channels on your feet all I see is a runner (ooh)
Akhi in a dinger tryna find opp (scrr)
That big banger have you tryna find God
Came for the riches, taking your mrs
Jay 1 told you he's joking but I'm not
Gold diggers looking for a pot of gold
Ice on my neck they don't know if I'm hot or cold (crazy)
They keep telling me that I'm a role model but I'm
Here telling models roll (ay yo babes where you going?)
Right back to the suite if I sleep with
My flicky does it mean I'm a G? (am I a G?)
I can't lie I fell in love with the beat but
There's not future she belongs to the street
