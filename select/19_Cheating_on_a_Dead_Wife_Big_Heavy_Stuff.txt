I'm eating, I confess, I dine for two
A loaf of wholemeal bread and wine
I'm cheating, I confess, and I'm confused
I'm cheating on a dead wife

Bring me over some good times
I'll deliver them
How many orders can I make?

They're bringing me your head, so I can choose
I've got so many letters to write
Believe me I'm impressed and if I was you
I'd still be cheating on a dead wife

Bring me over some good times
I'll deliver them
How many orders can I take?

Bring me over some bad times
I'll deliver them
How many orders can I make?

Bring me over some good times
I'll deliver them
How many orders can I make?

Bring me over some bad times
I'll deliver them
How many orders can I make?
